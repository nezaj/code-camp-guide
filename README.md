# How To Get Into A Programming Bootcamp (2015)
[Read PDF][PDF]

I attended a bootcamp in 2013 to switch careers into tech. I started working as an API engineer for a startup two months after graduating. Since then I've gone on to work at Facebook. I wrote this guide for people who are exploring and/or seriously considering attending a programming bootcamp.

You will find this useful if you have:

* Completed a couple of tutorials and think programming may be right for you. Alas, you don't have a C.S. degree though. But you heard about these bootcamps that teach you enough to get a job. It sounds too good to be true so you want some more information.
* Decided to apply but want more information and tips on the application process.
* Been accepted to bootcamp but want tips for ensuring success.

Good luck on your journey!
